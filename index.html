            <h3>Bachelor of Science, English-Taught Honours Programme in Software Engineering</h3>
            <p><b>Technical University of Moldova</b>, <i>September 2023 - Present</i></p>
            <p><i>Favorite course: </i> My favorite course so far was Domain-Specific Language Development, where I had the chance to work in a strong team environment and build an exciting final project. It was especially fun because it was my first time getting deeply involved in backend logic.</p>
            <p><i>Favorite memory: </i> Although my journey at UTM is still ongoing, some of my most enjoyable moments have come from working on team-based projects, especially during this year's internship experience.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Bachelor Degree, Transient Student</h3>
            <p><b>Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches, TX, USA</b>, <i>August 2024 - December 2024</i></p>
            <p><b>GPA:</b> 4.0</p>
            <p><i>Favorite course: </i> Object-Oriented Programming, where we applied core OOP principles by developing exciting games, including building a Snake game from scratch in Java as part of a team project. Another memorable highlight was American Sign Language (ASL), which was a fun and meaningful experience since I had long wanted to learn sign language. I also especially enjoyed Data Structures, a course I grew to love even more thanks to an inspiring professor I deeply respect. </p>
            <p><i>Favorite memory: </i> Spending time with my international group of friends was one of the most special parts of the semester, especially our final meal together, where I had everyone sign my check as a keepsake.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Baccalaureate Diploma</h3>
            <p><b>Theoretical Lyceum "Spiru Haret"</b>, <i>September 2020 - May 2023</i></p>

            <p><b>Final grade:</b> 9.5</p>
            <p><i>Favorite course: </i> Mathematics, a subject that helped me develop strong critical thinking and analytical skills. I was especially inspired by an outstanding teacher who could explain even the most difficult concepts in a clear and approachable way. I also greatly enjoyed Chemistry, as it fascinated me from a young age and sparked my curiosity about how the world works at a deeper level.</p>
            <p><i>Favorite memory: </i> One of my most cherished memories was decorating our school hall for autumn together with my classmates. We gathered colorful leaves and created a beautiful archway along with other seasonal decorations, making the school feel truly special.</p>
